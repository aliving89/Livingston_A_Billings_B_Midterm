            <h4>Brodys Pro XBOX</h4>
            <p>
                There are many reasons why i'm pro XBOX That will follow below. <br>
                <img src="images/xbox_series_x.jpg" alt="HALO XBOX Series X">

                I belive the consoles user interface is alot more clean and well developed (based on window 10 layout). <br>
                The Console it self is alot more simple looking and will age better than the playstation 5 and XBOX's controller is also alot more comfortable. <br>
                <br>
                Moving into the specs of the console although they are both very similar the XBOX does have 
                better specs on paper which adds a little bit more to the xbox side of things. <br>
                <br>
                Xbox also has better exclusive titles starting with Dead Rising the best know zombie slayer game.
                Moving deaper into exclusives XBOX offers Gears Of War/Forza and one of the best <br> franchises of all time
                HALO nothing can compare to the list of smaller studio exclusives xbox has aswell.

            <br> <br>
                XBOX's Gamepass service is also one of the best services you can be offered for a <br>
                monthly price. To back my claim some of the upcoming games that are set to launch on gamepass <br>
                are the new Forza Horizon (nov release) and the new HALO infinite online multiplayer <br>
                which you will be able to download for no initial cost ig you have Gamepass.
                <br>
                Overall I belive that XBOX is the brand of choice for console users
